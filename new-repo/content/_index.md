## About {#about}
Clinical decision making often draws on multiple diverse data sources including, but not limited to, images, text reports, electronic health records (EHR), continuous physiological signals and genomic profiles and yet most AI systems deployed in healthcare remain unimodal. However, integrating diverse medical modalities presents significant challenges including data heterogeneity, data scarcity, missing or asynchronous modalities, variable data quality and the lack of standardized frameworks for aligned representation learning. This workshop aims to bring the EurIPS community together to tackle the problem of fusing these heterogeneous inputs into interpretable, coherent patient representations, aiming to mirror the holistic reasoning of clinicians.
We aim to bring together machine learning researchers, clinicians and industry partners dedicated to the theory, methods, and translation of multimodal learning in healthcare.

### Goals
In this workshop, we aim to:
- Advance methods for learning joint representations from images, text, signals, and genomics.  
- Investigate foundation-model pretraining at scale on naturally paired modalities.  
- Address robustness, fairness, and missing-modality issues unique to healthcare fusion.  
- Foster clinician–ML collaboration and outline translational paths to deployment.
